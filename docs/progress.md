### Architecture Notes:
- Strict TypeScript enforced across all files
- Earth-tone green branding implemented in Tailwind config
- CI pipeline matches PRD requirements exactly (Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E, Lighthouse for performance budgets)
- Docker setup ready for single-server deployment with Cloudflare Tunnel integration
- Frontend components designed with PRD requirements in mind, using example images as inspiration rather than exact copies
