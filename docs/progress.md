## TASK 2 — Core Backend ✅ [2025-07-13T11:45:00Z]

### Completed Items:
- ✅ [2025-07-13T10:35:00Z] Implemented `lib/db.ts` with SQLite setup, migrations, and strict Zod schemas for all tables (users, children, media, comments, reactions)
- ✅ [2025-07-13T10:50:00Z] Created `lib/media.ts` with Sharp image processing (thumb 200px, medium 800px) and ffmpeg video transcoding (H.264, CRF 23 for optimal quality/size)
- ✅ [2025-07-13T11:10:00Z] Built `lib/auth.ts` with Cloudflare Access JWT simulation using `CF-Access-Jwt-Assertion` header, first user becomes admin
- ✅ [2025-07-13T11:30:00Z] Created comprehensive API routes:
  - `/api/health` - Docker health checks
  - `/api/auth/me` - User authentication status  
  - `/api/children` - Full CRUD for child management
  - `/api/upload` - Media upload with processing
  - `/api/media` - Media browsing with pagination
  - `/api/comments` - Comment CRUD with user permissions
  - `/api/reactions` - Heart reactions toggle
  - `/api/admin/users` - User role management (admin only)
- ✅ [2025-07-13T11:45:00Z] Implemented `service-worker.ts` with PWA offline support (media caching, request queuing, background sync)

### Architecture Details:
- **Database**: SQLite with WAL mode, foreign keys, comprehensive indexes for performance
- **Media Processing**: Hash-based file organization `/media/{child}/{YYYY}/{MM}/{hash}.ext` with separate thumbs subdirectory
- **Authentication**: Simulated Cloudflare Access JWT with dev fallback (`dev@example.com`), role-based permissions
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with Zod validation, proper error handling, soft deletes throughout
- **PWA Features**: Service worker caches last 50 media items, queues offline mutations, network-first for API, cache-first for media

### Next Tasks:
- TASK 3: Frontend Components (Albums grid, recents feed, slideshow modal, auth forms)
- TASK 4: Testing & CI (Unit tests, E2E tests, Lighthouse integration)

### Architecture Notes:
- Strict TypeScript enforced across all files
- Earth-tone green branding implemented in Tailwind config
- CI pipeline matches PRD requirements exactly (Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E, Lighthouse for performance budgets)
- Docker setup ready for single-server deployment with Cloudflare Tunnel integration
