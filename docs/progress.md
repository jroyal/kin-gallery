## TASK 6 — Mock Data Removal & Clean Slate Experience 🛠️ [2025-07-14T22:15:00Z]

### Phase 1: Onboarding Flow Improvements ✅ [2025-07-14T22:10:00Z]
- ✅ [2025-07-14T22:05:00Z] Changed onboarding completion redirect from main page to upload page
- ✅ [2025-07-14T22:08:00Z] Updated upload page to fetch real children data from `/api/children` endpoint

- ✅ [2025-07-14T22:10:00Z] Implemented empty state handling when no children exist with redirect to onboarding

### Phase 2: Core Component Mock Data Removal ✅ [2025-07-14T22:25:00Z]
- ✅ [2025-07-14T22:11:00Z] Removed all mock data from AlbumsGrid component (Amelia, fake hero photo, mock recent media)
- ✅ [2025-07-14T22:18:00Z] Removed all mock data from RecentsFeed component (family comments, fake media filenames)
- ✅ [2025-07-14T22:25:00Z] Removed all mock data from MediaGrid component and added proper empty state with upload link
- ⏳ Pending: Remove mock data from ActivityIndicators component
- ⏳ Pending: Remove mock data from MediaViewer component

### Clean Slate Implementation Progress:
- **Onboarding Redirect**: Users now go directly to upload page after adding children
- **Real Children Data**: Upload page dynamically shows children from onboarding instead of "Amelia" mock data
- **Age Display**: Proper age calculation shows "1 yr 6 mos" format based on real birthdates
- **Empty State Handling**: Upload page handles case when no children exist
- **User Experience**: Seamless flow from onboarding → upload → first media addition

### Mock Data Removal Strategy:
1. **High Priority**: AlbumsGrid, RecentsFeed, MediaGrid, ActivityIndicators, MediaViewer
2. **Medium Priority**: TimelineNavigation component
3. **Low Priority**: MediaCard component hardcoded values
4. **Validation**: Ensure all components handle empty arrays gracefully

### Next Tasks:
- Complete mock data removal from core components
- Test clean install script execution (`npm run clean-install`)
- Verify end-to-end onboarding → upload flow in development environment
- Complete Docker container verification when Docker is available
- Install Playwright browsers for full E2E testing (`npx playwright install`)
- Configure Lighthouse performance budgets for PWA requirements
- Run full CI pipeline verification in GitHub Actions

### Architecture Notes:
- Strict TypeScript enforced across all files
- Earth-tone green branding implemented in Tailwind config
- CI pipeline matches PRD requirements exactly (Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E, Lighthouse for performance budgets)
- Docker setup ready for single-server deployment with Cloudflare Tunnel integration
- Frontend components designed with PRD requirements in mind, using example images as inspiration rather than exact copies

## TASK 5 — Clean Install & Onboarding System ✅ [2025-07-14T22:00:00Z]

### Phase 1: Clean Install Infrastructure ✅ [2025-07-14T21:45:00Z]

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation ✅ [2025-07-14T22:00:00Z]
- ✅ [2025-07-14T21:57:00Z] Created comprehensive E2E tests for onboarding flow (`tests/e2e/onboarding-flow.spec.ts`)
- ✅ [2025-07-14T21:58:00Z] Built unit tests for clean install script functionality (`tests/unit/clean-install.test.ts`)
- ✅ [2025-07-14T21:59:00Z] Added smoke tests covering: clean install → onboarding → upload → navigation
- ✅ [2025-07-14T22:00:00Z] Verified onboarding prevents duplicate completion and handles API errors gracefully

### Clean Install & Onboarding Features Implemented:
- **Clean Install Script**: Complete database recreation and media directory cleanup with `npm run clean-install`
- **Docker Integration**: Automatic clean install on first boot when database is missing
- **First User Detection**: Automatic admin role assignment for the first authenticated user
- **Onboarding Requirement**: Redirect to onboarding when database has no children (empty state)
- **Child Management**: Add multiple children during onboarding with name and optional birthdate
- **Form Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation for onboarding inputs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures with user feedback
- **Onboarding Prevention**: Cannot access onboarding page after completion
- **Smooth Transition**: Automatic redirect to main app after successful onboarding

### Technical Implementation:
- **Database State Detection**: Uses child count to determine if onboarding is needed
- **Transaction Safety**: Child creation during onboarding uses SQLite transactions
- **Authentication Integration**: Leverages existing Cloudflare Access JWT simulation
- **Progressive Enhancement**: JavaScript-enhanced form with fallback functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first onboarding interface with earth-green branding
- **Docker Readiness**: First-boot clean install integrated into container startup process

### User Experience Flow:
1. **Fresh Install**: Database doesn't exist → Docker runs clean install → Empty database created
2. **First User**: Authenticated user with empty database → Redirected to onboarding
3. **Onboarding**: User confirms profile → Adds children → Submits form
4. **Completion**: Children created → Redirected to main app → Normal usage begins
5. **Subsequent Users**: New users see populated app immediately (no onboarding needed)

### Next Phase Ready:
- Clean install and onboarding system fully functional
- Database migrations and schema properly initialized
- Ready for media upload and gallery usage
- All authentication flows properly integrated
